## 🧠 Why LifeGraph?

Many people track their life with multiple apps:

* fitness apps
* productivity tools
* coding trackers

But the data is **fragmented**.

LifeGraph connects everything and lets you analyze your life like a dataset.

Example questions you can answer:

* Do I code better after sleeping 8 hours?
* Does exercise improve my mood?
* Does walking more increase productivity?

# 🚀 Quick Start

Follow these steps to run LifeGraph locally and generate your first life analytics charts.

---

## 1 Clone repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Evermaple/LifeGraph.git
cd lifegraph
```

---

## 2 Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 3 Initialize database

Create the SQLite database:

```bash
python -m app.db
```

This will create:

```
data/life.db
```

---

## 4 Generate demo data

To quickly test the analytics pipeline, generate sample life data:

```bash
python scripts/generate_demo_data.py
```

This will generate about **30 days of example metrics**.

Example data:

| date       | sleep | steps | mood | deepwork |
| ---------- | ----- | ----- | ---- | -------- |
| 2026-03-01 | 7.5   | 8200  | 4    | 3        |
| 2026-03-02 | 6.8   | 6000  | 3    | 2        |
| 2026-03-03 | 8.0   | 10000 | 5    | 4        |

---

## 5 Generate analytics charts

Run:

```bash
python -m analytics.charts
```

This will generate charts:

```
charts_sleep.html
charts_steps.html
sleep_mood.html
```

Open them in your browser.
